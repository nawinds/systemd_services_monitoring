# Systemd services monitoring bot
## Installation
#### !!! Before installation, please, read the notice below !!!
- The installation script updates Python and Python3 on the system to 3.8 version. 
- Running the installation script may cause failures in your existing python scripts and 
virtual environments, especially after restart of these scripts. If you experience 
such problems, go to the [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section.
- Installation script was primarily written for Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS. The 3.8 Python 
version choice was caused by the fact that Python >= 3.9 is not supported by this OS version, 
while aiogram does not support Python < 3.7.
- If you do not want Python 3.8 to be installed as the main Python interpreter in your system,
open install.sh script after cloning the repository and change 3.8 to any other Python >= 3.7 
version.
##### If you read and accepted all the notes above, let's install a monitoring bot!

### Installation process
#### 1. Create a new Telegram bot
Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot.
##### Don't forget to start a dialogue with your new bot so it could be able to write to you!

#### 2. Clone & install
##### Make sure, you read [our notice](#Installation) before running commands below
```shell script
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nawinds/systemd_services_monitoring.git
cd systemd_services_monitoring
sudo chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
After running `install.sh` you will be asked to enter your bot token that you have got at 
[@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

After that, enter bot admin IDs, dividing them with 
comma (e.g. `873847924,673435489,7674387483` or `873847924`)

#### 3. Modify your existing systemd services
After the `install.sh` script finishes, modify systemd services that you would like 
to add to the monitoring system.

Add `OnFailure=on-failure.service` directive inside `[Unit]` module 
of service configuration file. Remember to remove all other restart-on-fail 
directives from these services. The monitoring system automatically 
restarts failed services.

Do not forget to run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` after editing your services.

#### 4. Add services to bot
Go to your Telegram bot that you have created at [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

Send `/help` command to ensure that everything is OK. You will get a complete list 
of available bot commands. Use `/add service_name` to add `service_name.service` to 
the monitoring system.

#### 5. Enjoy!
Now your monitoring bot is running smoothly! Personalize it by adding botpic and commands 
list (get command description by sending /help) at [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), if you want.

## Troubleshooting
### â€” Some of my other Python scripts failed after installation of this script
As was written in the [installation notice](#Installation), the installation script 
installs and sets Python 3.8 as the default Python and Python3 interpreter in your system.
It's likely that your failures were connected with this update.
#### How to fix?
You should remove virtual environment directory of your failed projects:
```shell script
sudo rm -r venv
```
After that create venv again and install your project dependencies:
```shell script
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/pin/activate
pip3 install <required_modules>
```
Don't forget to replace `<required_modules>` with `-r requirements.txt` or module names.
